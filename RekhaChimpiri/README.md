### Web Application Development & Data Integration

- Updated [NASA image swiper integration](/feed) within FeedPlayer by troubleshooting media type compatibility issues and converting .mpg video entries to use .jpg format to ensure proper rendering across all browsers.

- Developed [travel distance calculator](https://github.com/ModelEarth/profile/pull/57) for interactive product menu, parsing YAML data to extract GWP values, mass per declared unit, and category default distances for environmental impact calculations

- Added [product UI enhancement](https://github.com/ModelEarth/profile/pull/59) that automatically hides UUID product lists upon selection while maintaining state persistence through URL hash parameters, ensuring proper navigation and bookmarking functionality using `updateHash()` and `getHash()` methods from localsite.js
