## Thanmayi Sai

Thanmayi is a lead contributor to the RealityStream project's Machine Learning and Data Science initiatives. Her expertise is instrumental in developing the **ML pipeline utilizing six models (including XGBoost and two Random Forest classifiers)** for forecasts related to key impact indicators like **tree canopy coverage** and **bee population density**.

**Key Technical Contributions:**

  * **Ecological Data Pipeline Automation:** She engineers robust, automated data pipelines, focusing on cleaning and integrating multi-year, county-level ecological datasets pulled directly from Google Data Commons.
  * **DCID-Based State-Level Processing:** Implements DCID-based state-level processing for the Forest Canopy indicator (specifically `LandCoverFraction_Forest`), allowing for dynamic analysis of canopy trends and the generation of ML targets based on canopy change.
  * **Workflow Streamlining:** Automates the generation and upload of target CSV files for both bee and canopy data directly from Colab to GitHub, ensuring datasets are reproducible and versioned for immediate model consumption.
  * **Model Execution Infrastructure:** Significantly enhances the `Run Models` tool by implementing a **generic DCID-based data pull function** and preparing YAML configuration files. This work enables parameter-driven model execution without requiring engineers to modify underlying code. She also integrates new parameters into the widget dropdown for simplified execution.

Thanmayi’s work establishes a scalable and efficient data foundation, directly enabling the project's forecasting capabilities.
